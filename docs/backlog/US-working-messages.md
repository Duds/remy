# User Story: Entertaining "Working" Messages

**As a user,**  
**I want** Remy to send funny and nonsensical status messages while processing tasks,  
**So that** I know the bot is active and I'm entertained during longer operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Replace the hardcoded `...` placeholder in message handlers with a dynamic selection of messages.
- [ ] Maintain a list of "SimCity-style" nonsensical phrases (e.g., "Reticulating splines", "Homologating girdles", "Calibrating flux capacitors").
- [ ] For longer tasks, the message should update periodically to show progress/activity.
- [ ] The final response should still replace the "working" message entirely once ready.

## Proposed Implementation

Modify `remy/bot/handlers.py` to use a helper function for the initial "processing" message.

### Potential Phrases

- Reticulating splines...
- Homologating girdles...
- Buffering logic...
- Consulting the oracle...
- Polishing the chrome...
- Reheating the coffee...
- Generating excuses...
- Aligning the stars...
- Herding cats...

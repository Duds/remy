## Summary
As a [user / developer], I want [goal] so that [benefit].

One to two sentences maximum. Should be understandable without reading the rest.

---

## Background

Describe *why* this is needed. Reference the relevant phase/section in `TODO.md`.
Explain what currently happens and why it is insufficient.

Link to related files, prior bugs, or design decisions where helpful.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Criterion one.** Specific and testable.
2. **Criterion two.** Avoid vague qualifiers like "fast" or "good" — use measurable
   thresholds where possible.
3. **Edge case / regression.** Existing behaviour that must not break.

---

## Implementation

**Files:** list of files to create or modify.

Describe the approach at the level needed to unambiguously implement the story.
Include code sketches where the interface is non-obvious. Omit boilerplate.

```python
# Code sketch — not a full implementation
```

### Notes
- Key constraints, gotchas, or ordering dependencies between sub-tasks.
- If the story depends on another US, call it out explicitly.

## Test Cases

| Scenario | Expected |
|---|---|
| Happy path | Correct output |
| Edge case | Graceful handling |
| Regression | Existing behaviour unchanged |

## Out of Scope

- Things this story explicitly does NOT cover.
- Related features deferred to other stories (link them).
